# Building this website

## Motivation

As a scientist and artist, two of my gratest passions is sharing how I see the Universe, be it scientifically or artistically! Here is a space precisely to do this!


<!-- Science + Art = Wonder -->

## Meet Julia, Franklin, and Github

Before asking myself how to build and host this website I needed to ask myself where to host it. Github Pages was a very natural choice for me. Despite it requiring some setup and not being very lay-person friendly, my experience with programing throughout my academic career was more than enough to to work through it.

TALK ABOUT FRANKLIN HERE

I do not have much experience with Julia. Most of my programming experience is with Python. However, I am very passionated about this language, both for its simplicity and flexibility as well as a very active and lively developpers community. Thereby, I saw this new project of building my website as a perfect opportunity to practice programming in Julia with a deliverable product.




```julia:./exdot.jl
using LinearAlgebra
a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]
@show dot(a, a)
println(dot(a, a))
```

You can now show what this would look like:

\output{./exdot.jl}

**Notes**:
* you don't have to specify the `.jl` (see below),
* you do need to explicitly use print statements or `@show` for things to show, so just leaving a variable at the end like you would in the REPL will show nothing,
* only Julia code blocks are supported at the moment, there may be a support for scripting languages like `R` or `python` in the future,
* the way you specify the path is important; see [the docs](https://franklinjl.org/code/#more_on_paths) for more info. If you don't care about how things are structured in your `/assets/` folder, just use `./scriptname.jl`. If you want things to be grouped, use `./group/scriptname.jl`. For more involved uses, see the docs.

Lastly, it's important to realise that if you don't change the content of the code, then that code will only be executed _once_ even if you make multiple changes to the text around it.

Here's another example,

```julia:./code/ex2
for i ∈ 1:5, j ∈ 1:5
    print(" ", rpad("*"^i,5), lpad("*"^(6-i),5), j==5 ? "\n" : " "^4)
end
```

which gives the (utterly useless):

\output{./code/ex2}

note the absence of `.jl`, it's inferred.

You can also hide lines (that will be executed nonetheless):

```julia:./code/ex3
using Random
Random.seed!(1) # hide
@show randn(2)
```

\output{./code/ex3}


## Including scripts

Another approach is to include the content of a script that has already been executed.
This can be an alternative to the description above if you'd like to only run the code once because it's particularly slow or because it's not Julia code.
For this you can use the `\input` command specifying which language it should be tagged as:


\input{julia}{/_assets/scripts/script1.jl} <!--_-->


these scripts can be run in such a way that their output is also saved to file, see `scripts/generate_results.jl` for instance, and you can then also input the results:

\output{/_assets/scripts/script1.jl} <!--_-->

which is convenient if you're presenting code.

**Note**: paths specification matters, see [the docs](https://franklinjl.org/code/#more_on_paths) for details.

Using this approach with the `generate_results.jl` file also makes sure that all the code on your website works and that all results match the code which makes maintenance easier.
